Predicting the prices of stock market

In this project, the plan is to do stock value prediction. 

It is planned to use the data set whose link is given below. However, the used dataset may be varied according to the will.

In addition to that, this data can be related to Coronavirus, if the time permits. 
For test data, the plan is to train the model with year 1970-2015 betweens such that the accuracy can be tested with a dataset between 2015 and 2018. 

The stock price prediction is done via the advanced regression using Long Term Short Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in Tensoflow.
